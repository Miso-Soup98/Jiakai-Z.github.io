Objective
======
The aim of this project is to conduct a combinatorial study using different pattern recognition and classification algorithms to find an optimal method for classifying real-time MI EEG signals under big data.

Results
======

- Four algorithm combinations were investigated, and the results showed that, as the best combination of spatial filtering and classification algorithms, the TRCSP-SVM method shows great potential for improving the performance of lower-limb KMI systems.

- Published a research paper on Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing.

- Applied for a Chinese [patent](https://miso-soup98.github.io/Jiakai-Z.github.io/images/ERD.jpg) based on the research findings.
