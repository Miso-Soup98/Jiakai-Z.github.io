Objective
======

The aim of this project is to find a way to use EEG signals to achieve efficient and stable control of the cursor of a general computer and to perform some basic operational functions.

Results
======

- Provide a novel virtual cursor control system based on a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) that combines eye tracking with motor imagery (MI).

- Proposed a self-designed sliding window approach which improved cursor control's accuracy and simplicity by properly distinguishing the cursor key commands' output.

- Proposed a "desire factor"-based jitter optimization approach which achieved 96.1% cursor stability.

- Submitted a research paper on Computers in Biology and Medicine.

- Applied for two Chinese patents ([1](https://miso-soup98.github.io/Jiakai-Z.github.io/images/light.jpg),[2](https://miso-soup98.github.io/Jiakai-Z.github.io/images/eye-smart.jpg)) based on the research findings.
