Objective
======

The aim of this project was to find a way to improve the speed and accuracy of real-time classification of MI EEG signals. As well as applying real-time control functions to external devices to realize autonomous control.

Results
======

- Proposed a label-based channel diversion preprocessing method for real-time processing of MI EEG signals, which was subsequently applied to lighting control.

- Achieved high accuracy in real-time three-class classification by using only three channels (average real-time accuracy reached 87.46%, with a maximum of 90.33%).

- Published a research paper on Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine.
