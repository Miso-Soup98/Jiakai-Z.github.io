title: "A high-performance general computer cursor control scheme based on a hybrid BCI combining motor imagery and eye-tracking"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel virtual cursor control system using a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) that combines eye tracking and motor imagery (MI). Two methods were proposed to enhance cursor control accuracy and stability. Real-time classification accuracy reaches 87.92%, with a peak of 93.33%. The technology can be integrated into common computer systems, enabling individuals with neuromuscular disabilities to perform tasks like text entry (with an average text input rate of 53.2 characters per minute), online communication, and web browsing, improving their online integration and inspiring future BCI developments.'
