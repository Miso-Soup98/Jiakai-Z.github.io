This study examines a motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) for differentiating between left and right foot motor imagery in spinal cord injury patients. We employ Tikhonov regularized CSP (TRCSP) and compare various classification methods. The TRCSP-SVM method outperforms the rest with an average accuracy of 97%, improving accuracy by up to 10%. These findings provide valuable insights for lower limb MI-BCI systems in rehabilitation training.
