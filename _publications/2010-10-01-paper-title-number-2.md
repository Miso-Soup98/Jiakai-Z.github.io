excerpt: 'This study addresses the challenge of low real-time classification accuracy in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for controlling intelligent devices. We propose a label-based channel diversion preprocessing method, utilizing the TRCSP and OVR-SVM algorithms. The results are promising, achieving high accuracy in real-time three-class classification using only three channels (averaging 87.46% with a peak of 90.33%). The system's stability is confirmed through real-world lighting control experiments, paving the way for more effective BCIs in practical applications.'

This study addresses the challenge of low real-time classification accuracy in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for controlling intelligent devices. We propose a label-based channel diversion preprocessing method, utilizing the TRCSP and OVR-SVM algorithms. The results are promising, achieving high accuracy in real-time three-class classification using only three channels (averaging 87.46% with a peak of 90.33%). The system's stability is confirmed through real-world lighting control experiments, paving the way for more effective BCIs in practical applications.
