I am currently a third-year master's student at the [**School of Information Science and Technology**](https://sist.ntu.edu.cn/), [**Nantong University**](https://www.ntu.edu.cn/). My primary research focus lies in **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**, particularly in **EEG signal acquisition and processing algorithms**, as well as **real-time control of BCI external devices**. Under the esteemed guidance of [**Professor Shen Xiaoyan**](https://sist.ntu.edu.cn/2019/0319/c5297a137869/page.htm), I have had the opportunity to be involved in multiple competitions and projects during my postgraduate journey. My academic contributions include two published SCI papers, another under review, and four patents to my name.

### Hobbies

Outside of my academic pursuits, I am passionate about sports and outdoor activities. Here are some of my favorite activities:
- Badminton
- Fishing
- Mountain Hiking
- Running
